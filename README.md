#### Methodology:
A segmentation analysis was conducted on the airline customer satisfaction dataset via Enginius platform, which includes 4999 reviews provided by business class passengers. The segmentation analysis groups passengers based on their satisfaction levels across 14 different service aspects and a persona for each segment is then created by taking into account the descriptors variables to understand the needs and preferences of each segment better and identify opportunities to improve their overall travel experience.

K-means was used for analysis instead of hierarchical clustering techinque because of high data volumne.
